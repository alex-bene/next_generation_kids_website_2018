"Prometheus" is a non-profit research team of the National Technical University of Athens - Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. "Prometheus" members design and construct high efficiency electric vehicles. All students are undergraduates and PhD candidates of the specific department. With raw materials and passion "Prometheus" members change the way we move. With a hand-made, eco-friendly, prototype, electric vehicle constructed from scratch, an 1.000 km trip will now cost less than 20 cents of a euro.
